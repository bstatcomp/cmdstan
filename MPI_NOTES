To get the MPI example working, please follow

1. checkout the stan-math branch feature/concept-mpi-2 somewhere
2. update make/local such that MATH points to this directory (with a
trailing "/")
3. make stan-mpi
4. make build
5. make examples/mpi/oral_2cmt_mpi4

Finally, please ensure that you have on a Mac the variable

DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(BOOST)/stage/lib

set accordingly. 

Things have been setup to work on Mac, please adjust the call to stanc
make/models accordingly to esnure that the dynamic libraries are
found.
